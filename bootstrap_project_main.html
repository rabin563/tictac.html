    <p class="fs-5 mt-3">
      A computer is an electronic device that processes data and performs tasks according to instructions given by software and hardware. It can store, retrieve, and manipulate information quickly and accurately. Computers are used in various fields like education, healthcare, business, and communication. They come in different forms such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and servers. Modern computers are powerful and efficient, helping users create documents, browse the internet, play games, and manage large databases. With advancements in artificial intelligence and cloud computing, computers continue to evolve and impact our daily lives. They are essential tools in today's digital world.

    <p class="fs-5 mt-5">A machine is a man-made device designed to perform tasks, often using mechanical, electrical, or digital components. Machines simplify human work by increasing speed, precision, and efficiency. They are used in industries, homes, transportation, and communication. From simple tools to complex systems, machines play a vital role in modern life.</p>

<p>C is a powerful and widely-used general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It was initially created to develop the UNIX operating system and has since become the foundation for many modern programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.

C is known for its efficiency, speed, and close interaction with hardware, making it ideal for system programming such as operating systems, embedded systems, and device drivers. It supports structured programming, allowing developers to break programs into functions or modules, which improves readability and reusability.

One of the key features of C is its use of pointers, which enables direct memory access and manipulation. It also provides low-level operations, which offer greater control over system resources. Despite its age, C remains relevant due to its simplicity and performance advantages.

C is compiled, meaning source code is converted into machine code, which the computer can execute directly. It includes essential concepts like data types, loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions. Although it lacks built-in object-oriented features, it is an excellent language for understanding the fundamentals of programming and computer architecture.

Learning C provides a strong foundation for aspiring programmers and engineers.</p>
